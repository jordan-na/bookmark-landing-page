## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- ES6 module patterns with IIEF's

### What I learned

-  Non-technical skills:

   -  How to turn an abstract concept into concrete results by breaking the task at hand into smaller tasks
   -  Ability to plan and stick to a work schedule with an estimated date of completion
      -  Day 1: Create desktop design (HTML, CSS)
      -  Day 2: Create mobile design (HTML, CSS)
      -  Day 3: Implement vanilla JS
   -  Perserverance to finish the task, even through challenging times

-  Technical skills:
   -  Responsive UI/UX development
      -  Using the chrome inspector to emulate different screen sizes
   -  Using CSS grid to create responsive and dynamic layouts
   -  CSS media queries


### Continued development

-  I will continue to refine my vanilla JS and no-framwork CSS approach before moving onto libraries/frameworks
-  After I have complete a multitude of no library/framework projects, I will learn _React_ and implement it with my knowledge of _Node.js_ and _Express.js_
- Eventually, the goal is to complete a full stack web app that has a use for society

### Useful resources

-  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This helped me by acting as a reference for the built in js API
